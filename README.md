## How to use codes?
After buying the course, you may start to watch the course's episodes consecutively. For Each video, there is some codes or atleast an explanation of what is going on it. After watching an episode (video), if the episode (video) comprises a code, you only have to uncomment those executable lines and run the program. After that, comment them again and go after the next episode (video) codes and repeat this loop again :)

Enjoy!
